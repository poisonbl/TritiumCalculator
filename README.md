# EDMC Tritium Mining Calculator Plugin

Simple, no configuration needed. Displays a cumulative count of tritium rocks vs total prospected, average percent tritium found vs tritium rocks *and* total prospected rocks, and total tons mined/tons per hour rate. Calculates over the whole session, from the first rock prospected or ton refined to the last of either. Reset clears the counters and starts over.

## Installation

  * On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the “Open” button. This reveals the `plugins` folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
  * Download the [latest release](https://github.com/poisonbl/TritiumCalculator/releases/latest) of this plugin.
  * Open the `.zip` archive that you downloaded and move the `TritiumCalculator` folder contained inside into the `plugins` folder.

  _You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin._
